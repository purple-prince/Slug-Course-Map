Comprehensive reference app, academic planning tool, social app for UCSC.

Just a primitive proof of concept :)

Features as of now:

- localized, interactive map
- reference to virtually all consistent informtion provided by ucsc (without API access!) regarding all majors, minors, & courses for undergraduate and graduate study
- credit tracking, course & degree progress tracking
- view & write reviews on courses & degrees
- view live menus for dining halls (buggy)

<br>
coming up:

- menu fixes
- add teacher info & reviews
- find a way for ucsc to let me use their non-existent apis
- make ui cooler
- AI course & teacher recommendations
